ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!

You are about to face the Elite Four and your Pokemon has just reached level 65, the next Elite Four member that you are going to face is Wade the Water type leader. You would like to change the move of Dragonite from Fire Blast to Thunder. Also, you decided that you would like to start the game with Dragonite instead of Cherubi.

let pokemonParty = [{name: "Cherubi", move: "Charm"}, {name: "Pikachu", move: "Thunderbolt"}, {name: "Dragonite", move: "Fire Blast"}, {name: "Feraligatr", move: "Surf"}]

Return your pokemonParty with the updated moveset, as well as swapping the positions of Cherubi and Dragonite in your party.
